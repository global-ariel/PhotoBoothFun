## Sprint Task Lifecycle Protocol (Pattern-TRACKING-001)

**Added:** 2025-01-12 (v1.1 - Sprint TOML automation)

### Before Starting ANY Task

**Update Sprint TOML status to "in_progress"**:

**Option 1 - Automated (Preferred)**:
```bash
/sprint-task-lifecycle start {TASK-ID}
```

**Option 2 - Manual (if skill unavailable)**:
1. Find task: `grep -n "^\[tasks.{TASK-ID}\]" internal/sprints/ACTIVE_SPRINT.toml`
2. Read task section (use Read tool)
3. Edit: `status = "pending"` → `status = "in_progress"`
4. Validate: `grep -A 1 "^\[tasks.{TASK-ID}\]" ... | grep status`

**Integration with TodoWrite**:
- Add Sprint TOML update as first TodoWrite item (Step 0A)
- Mark in_progress AFTER Sprint TOML updated
- Ensures Sprint Panel UI reflects current work

---

### After Completing ANY Task

**Update Sprint TOML status to "completed"**:

**Option 1 - Automated (Preferred)**:
```bash
/sprint-task-lifecycle complete {TASK-ID}
```

**Option 2 - Manual (if skill unavailable)**:
1. Read task section
2. Edit:
   ```
   old_string: status = "in_progress"
   new_string: status = "completed"
   completed_date = "2025-01-12"
   ```
3. Validate: Check both status and completed_date present

**Integration with TodoWrite**:
- Add Sprint TOML update as final TodoWrite item (Step N)
- Mark completed AFTER Sprint TOML updated
- Ensures Sprint Panel UI reflects task completion

---

### If Blocked/Deferred

**Update Sprint TOML status to "deferred"**:

**Option 1 - Automated (Preferred)**:
```bash
/sprint-task-lifecycle defer {TASK-ID} "Reason for deferral"
```

**Option 2 - Manual (if skill unavailable)**:
1. Edit:
   ```
   old_string: status = "in_progress"
   new_string: status = "deferred"
   deferred_reason = "{REASON}"
   ```
2. Document blocker, notify user, move to next task

---

**Full Protocol**: See Pattern-TRACKING-001 (Sprint TOML Lifecycle Management section)

**Validation**: Pre-commit hook runs `validate-sprint-schema.js` automatically

---

**You are now ready to execute planning tasks autonomously.**
